Welcome to the **Random Shop** project! This repository contains the implementation of a fictional shop where chaos reigns, and customers never know what they're going to buy or how much they'll pay for it.

## Introduction

In **Random Shop**, we embrace chaos as our core identity. When customers visit our store, we want them to feel completely lost, unaware of what they will buy or how much they will pay for it. Currently, our stock consists of pets, gourmet products, Magic: The Gathering cards, and outlet footwear.
